LEOCHARRE::Dev - tools to help manage distro development and maintenance
========================================================================

This package is a collection of modules and scripts to aid in development.
Most of the functionality is in the set of cli scripts provided in distro,
these reside under bin/

This distro is a set of tools to help me manage a distro- and development.
It is in my namespace because a lot of the scripts and methods here are already available in other packages.

I find these set of tools very valuable.

For example, 

   - automatically generate pod from source
   - analize your distro and tell what modules are deps and what versions are currently installed
   - auto Makefile.PL and MANIFEST generation
   - check out what version of a module is installed and if it's the most current on cpan
   - etc

This package will not likely work well on non POSIX systems.

To install

   perl Makefile.PL
   make install
